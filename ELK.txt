Elastic Search ELK:
● Elastic Search (db Engine) Summary: [[{db_engine.log_collect,elk,elk.logstash,elk.kibana,db_engine.search]]
- ElasticSearch cluster solutions in practice means: 
  - Deploy dozens of machines/containers.
  - Server tuning
  - mapping writing: i.e., - deciding how the data is:
    - tokenized
    - analyzed
    - indexed
    depending of user's requirements, internal limitations, and 
    available hardware resources.

- Elasticsearch is the central piece of ELK (Elastic Search, Logstash, and Kibana)
- developed and maintained by Elastic.
- Elasticsearch:
  - Add clustering and enterprise features on top of the Apache Lucene Library.
  - Originally designed for text-search indexation. 
    New versions can be used as a general data indexing solution.
    Extracted from: @[https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/requirements/requirements/]
    """ ...the "data" folder houses the Elasticsearch indices on which a huge amount
        of I/O will be done when the server is up and running. Great read ⅋ write
        hard drive performance will therefore have a great impact on the overall
        server performance.

● Cerebro: ELK admin GUI: [[{elk,01_PM.low_code,qa,troubleshooting,01_PM.TODO]]
@[https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/cerebro-webui-elk-cluster]
- OOSS (MIT License) elasticsearch web admin tool built using Scala,
  Play Framework, AngularJS, and Bootstrap.
- Elasticsearch comes as a set of blocks, and you—as a designer - are supposed
  to glue them together. Yet, the way the software comes out of the box does not
  cover everything. So, to me, it was not easy to see the cluster's heartbeat
  all in one place. I needed something to give me an overview as well as allow me
  to take action on basic things.
  I wanted to introduce you to a helpful piece of software I found: Cerebro.

● Logstash (Collector) [[{]elk.logstash,data.collection,01_PM.TODO]
- pipeline to ingest/transform/load logs  into a store like Elastic Search
  (It is common to replace Logstash with Fluentd)

- https://github.com/logstash-plugins (extend Logstash's functionality).
  - logstash-codec-protobuf  parsing Protobuf messages
  - logstash-integration-kafka
  - logstash-filter-elasticsearch
  - amazon-s3-storage
  - logstash-codec-csv
  - ...

- Logstash Alternatives: [[02_doc_has.comparative]]
  - Graylog:
    - log management tool based on Java, ElasticSearch and MongoDB.
       Graylog can be used to collect, index and analyze 
       any server log from a centralized location or distributed location. We can 
       easily monitor any unusual activity for debugging applications and logs using 
       Graylog. Graylog provides a powerful query language, alerting abilities, a 
       processing pipeline for data transformation and much more. We also can extend 
       the functionality of Graylog through a REST API and Add-ons.
      - gaining popularity in the Go community with
        the introduction of the Graylog Collector Sidecar
        written in Go.
      - ... it still lags far behind the ELK stack.
      - Composed  under the hood of:
        - Elasticsearch
        - MongoDB
        - Graylog Server.
      - comes with alerting built into the open source version
        and streaming, message rewriting, geolocation, ....
      - Ex:
      @[https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-monitor-log-files-with-graylog-v31-on-debian-10/]

  - Fluentd: It is not a global log aggregation system but a local one.
    -  Adopted by the CNCF as Incubating project.
    -  Recommended by AWS and Google Cloud.
    -  Common replacement for Logstash
        - It acts as a local aggregator to collect all node logs and send them off to central
          storage systems.
    -  500+ plugins for  quick and easy integrations with 
       different data input/outputs.                      
    -  common choice in Kubernetes environments due to: 
       - low memory requirements (tens of megabytes)    
         (each pod has a Fluentd sidecar)               
       - high throughput.                               

● Kibana (ELK UI) Summary: [[{elk.kibana,02_DOC_HAS.comparative,01_PM.TODO]]
- Analytical UI results extracted from ElasticSearch.
- Kibana Alternatives:
  - Grafana: lower level UI for infrastructure data visualization.
             Directly can inject data from many sources.
             Kibana must use logstash to inject from non-elasticsearch sources.
  
  - Tableau: Very simple to  use and ability to produce interactive visualizations.
             - well suited to handling the huge and very fast-changing datasets 
             - integrates with Hadoop, Amazon AWS, My SQL, SAP, Teradata, ....
  - Qlikview: Tableau’s biggest competitor.
  - FusionCharts: non free JavaScript-based charting and visualization package 
                  90+ different chart types, 
                  rather than having to start each new visualization from scratch, users
                  can pick from "live" example templates.
  - Highcharts:  non free. (It can be used freely as a trial, non-commercial or personal use).
  - Datawrapper: increasingly popular choice to present charts and statistics.
                 - simple, clear interface 
                 - very easy to upload csv data and create straightforward charts, also maps,
                   ...
  - Plotly    : Plotly enables more complex and sophisticated visualizations, 
                -  Integrats with analytics-oriented programming languages such as Python, R and Matlab. 
                -  built on top of the open source d3.js.
                -  Free/Non free licence.
                -  support for APIs such as Salesforce.
  
  - Sisense    : full stack analytics platform but its visualization capabilities.
                 simple-to-use drag and drop interface.
                 Dashboards can then be shared across organizations.
