- Building the future of event-driven architectures.
- Open source tools to easily build and maintain your event-driven architecture.
- All powered by the AsyncAPI specification, the industry standard for defining
  asynchronous APIs.

• eBay Adopts AsyncAPI for Asynchronous API Contracts
  https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/05/ebay-adopts-asyncapi/ 
  One of the critical AsyncAPI features that eBay's team has found 
  particularly useful is a clean separation 
  between channels, operations, and servers. A channel represents an 
  event stream, an operation describes a publish or subscribe process, 
  and a server facilitates the message transfer (i.e., the message 
  bus). This separation allows a complete representation 
  of producers, consumers, and message schemas, resulting in a 
  standardized model of a message-driven ecosystem.
