## beanstalkd: simple, fast work queue [[{PM.low_code]]

* <https://beanstalkd.github.io/.>

* https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/pages/common/beanstalkd.md
  A simple and generic work-queue server.

* very light KISS work queue, with features to prioritize the tasks, delete job
  on completion, bury job on failure, give ttr(time to run) to job
  and can push job in tube(queue) with delay. 
* Inspired from Memcached.  
*  Many monitoring tools are contributed by the Community.
 originally designed for reducing the latency of page views in
  high-volume web applications by running time-consuming tasks
  asynchronously.
