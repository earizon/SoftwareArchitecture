● GraphQL: [[{data.graphql,qa.standards,api,protocol.client_server,data.integration,01_PM.low_code,_PM.TODO]]
• GraphQL: Facebook-developed language that provides a powerful API to get only
  the dataset you need in a single request, seamlessly combining data sources.
• Replacement for REST and non-standandard ORM mapping tools that offers
  (10x) speed improvements and removes the need for custom (vs DDBB) caches.

• REF: https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-graphql
  The purpose of this monorepo is to give the GraphQL Community:
      a to-specification official language service (see: API Docs)
      a comprehensive LSP server and CLI service for use with IDEs
      a codemirror mode
      a monaco mode (in the works)
      an example of how to use this ecosystem with GraphiQL.
      examples of how to implement or extend GraphiQL.
