● Jepsen Project  [[{distributed.qa,01_PM.TODO]]
@[https://jepsen.io/]
Jepsen is an effort to improve the safety of distributed databases, queues,
consensus systems, etc. We maintain an open source software library for systems
testing, as well as blog posts and conference talks exploring particular
systems’ failure modes. In each analysis we explore whether the system lives
up to its documentation’s claims, file new bugs, and suggest recommendations
for operators.

Jepsen pushes vendors to make accurate claims and test their software
rigorously, helps users choose databases and queues that fit their needs, and
teaches engineers how to evaluate distributed systems correctness for
themselves.

● Grafana 9 Brings Big Improvements to Alerting and User Experience  @ma
  https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/07/grafana-9-released/ 
    Changes to the alerting experience, trialed as an option in earlier
  versions of Grafana, have now been made the default, leading to
  several improvements:
    Alerts are now streamlined and simplified across multiple data
  sources and Grafana deployments. 
    Alerts are now available based on a single rule, regardless of
  whether they are tied to a specific panel or dashboard. This removes
  a limitation that was previously in place.
    Alerts can now be multi-dimensional - so a single alert can
  be triggered by more than one item triggering the rule.   
    Grouping and routing of alerts are also improved, with
  notification policies allowing admins to bundle alerts together -
  preventing a potential storm of notifications when multiple alerts
  fire.   
   Granular alert muting and silencing are also now possible, allowing
  admins to prevent notifications at certain times (such as weekends), and to
  turn off notifications for an already existent alert temporarily.
