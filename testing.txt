  Outputting data to collect for later analysis is as simple as writing
  a JSON object to stdout. You can review the data we collect from each
  test on the test details page in the dashboard, build your own
  metrics and analytics dashboards with Kibana, and write your own
  custom data analysis and reports using Jupyter Notebooks.
